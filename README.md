### Project Overview 
The purpose of this project is to evaluate the impact of social media, specifically Elon Musk's tweets, on cryptocurrency prices with a focus on Dogecoin. Using historical price data and tweet logs, this analysis aims to quantify the influence of social media and explore implications for market volatility.

### Data Sources

The data provided was sourced via Kaggle

### Tools

- Python: Data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook: Code execution and exploration.
- Monte Carlo Simulation: Prediction and modeling.

### Exploratory Analysis 

#### Key Metrics and Methods
1. Correlation Analysis:
Examined relationships between tweet frequency and Dogecoin price volatility.
2. Monte Carlo Simulation:
Used historical data to project price trends absent of tweet influence.
3. Visualization:
Highlighted spikes in price corresponding to key tweets.


### Findings

#### Key Insights:
- Strong correlation between tweets mentioning Dogecoin and significant price fluctuations.
- Monte Carlo simulations suggest actual prices often exceed predicted ranges following high-profile tweets.

### Recommendations

1. Investors should:
    - Remain cautious of over-reliance on social media trends due to high volatility.
    - Diversify portfolios to mitigate risk associated with influencer-driven markets.
2. Platforms should:
    - Increase transparency in disclosing potential market manipulation.

### Limitations
Limitations
- Data Granularity: Analysis excludes non-text tweet content (e.g., images).
- External Factors: Does not isolate global economic events or broader crypto trends.
